# Use %display% to get the player's display name.
#
# Custom reward syntaxes:
# send:<bold>test - sends a message
# vault:-87 - deposits a specific amount of money (Vault required)

# Interval rewards
# Rewards which will be given at certain intervals.
# An interval of 10 means a player will get a reward at 10, 20, 30, etc.
