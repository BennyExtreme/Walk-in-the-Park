Walk in the Park

v3.0.0
## Important
# v3.0.0 has reworked every message and item. Languages which I don't speak have been removed from support.
# The previous lang.yml/items.yml are still saved. If you want to add your own language, copy the default English one
# and replace all messages with the previous ones. You will have to add your own messages, since I can't translate
# all of them. I hope you understand.

    > These new colouring schemes have been moved to <file>-v3.yml.

    > I know this is a pain, but so much has been changed that it's very difficult to transfer old formats to v3.
