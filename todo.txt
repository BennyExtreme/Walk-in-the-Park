    > Added 2 block trail behind players' parkour to decrease chance of blocks disappearing in front of player
- Added inventory saving to files for backup
    > Use /witp recoverinventory.
    > Useful for recovering inventories after crashes.
- Changed glass pane to white glass pane for better compatibility with certain resource packs and better visibility
- Fixed errors on join/leave causing incomplete setups for joining or leaving
    > This should massively improve reliability and reduce the impact of errors.
- Fixed structures not counting to total score
- Fixed blocks spawning in unloaded chunks
- Fixed SQL handling not being updated to the new config system
